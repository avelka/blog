# Salut, I'm **Antoine** ! 


French developer working in Germany, I build websites using various tools and technologies, such as HTML, CSS and Javascript for the front-end, with the help of various frameworks (often react, sometimes others...). I do some backend too, I have mostly worked with PHP/Laravel and have few experiences with node/express. Other than that, I sometime try new stack on personal projects and experiments.

I currently work for a large online store based in Munich.

I have interests in the following fields:
- **UX and accessibility**: coming from a graphic design background, this was my entrypoint in web engineering, and still of great importance for my daily work approach.
- **Security and Authentication** I recently had the chance to integrate an advanced [*OpenIdConnect*](https://openid.net) implementation for a bank identification and payment related project. This gave me the opportunity to discover some of the latest and safest authentication techniques in use today. I hope I will be able to explore this topic deeper in the future. 
- **Remote work, Developer experience and ergonomics.** 
I was already doing some HomeOffice days before the pandemic, but the past couple of years gave me the opportunity to review how I organized my work habits and environnement.


I decided to setup this platform for a few reasons:
- Using complex tech stack leveraging bazillion of package and frameworks at work, I wanted a space where I could experiment with more bare technology, without all the abstractions and complexity brought by "modern" project setup. The JAMStack is perfect for that and still powerfulenough to save me the hassle of managing everything by hand.
- I need to practice at writing, improve my communication skill, and update or extend my technical knowledge in general.
- I am not a fan of publishing platform such as medium.
