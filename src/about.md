# Salut, I'm **Antoine** ! 

French developer working in Germany, I build websites using various tools and technologies, such as HTML, CSS and Javascript for the front-end, with the help of various frameworks (often react, sometimes others...). I do some backend too, I have worked mostly with PHP/Laravel and have few experiences with node/express. Other than that, I sometime try new stack on personal projects and experiments.

I currently work for a large online store based in Munich.

I have interests in the following fields:
- **UX and accessibility**: coming from a graphic design background, this was my entrypoint in web engineering, and still of great importance for my daily work approach.
- **Security and Authentication** I recently had the chance to integrate an advanced *OpenIdConnect* implementation, for a bank identification and payment related project. This gave me the opportunity to discover some of the latest and safest authentication techniques in use today. I hope I will be able to develop more on this topic. 
- **Remote work, Developer experience and ergonomics.** 
I was already doing some HomeOffice days before the pandemic, but the past couple of years gave me the opportunity to review how I organized my work habits and environnement.
