# Salut, moi c'est **Antoine** ! 

I am a french web developer working in Germany. I build website using various technologies, such  as HTML, CSS and Javascript for the front-end, with the help of diverse frameworks (often react, but others too...). I do some backend too, I have worked with PHP and Laravel, node and express and played a little with flask and Django.

I have interests in the following fields:
- **UX and accessibility**, I was formed as a Graphic Designer and keep a keen eye on those topic. Sadly I have not alway got the opportunity to invest as much time as I wanted in this area, I plan to change that and use this space to document my progress.   
- **Performances**, don't we all ?
- **Authentication and security.** I have worked with advanced *OAuth* and OpenIdConnect implementation, I also have the objective to progress in this area.

- **Remote work, Developer experience and ergonomics.** 
I was already doing some HomeOffice days before the pandemic, but the past couple of years gave me the opportunity to reevaluate how I organized my work habits and environnement.
